# Varint Encoding and Decoding

Python functions for encoding and decoding integers using [Base 128 Varints](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/encoding/#varints).

Varints efficiently encode integers using a variable number of bytes, optimizing storage and transmission. Each byte represents 7 bits of the number, utilizing the most significant bit as a continuation indicator. This enables varints to represent integers of varying magnitudes with minimal overhead.
